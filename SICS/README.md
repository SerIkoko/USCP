# IntSocketProject

A simple Java client-server application demonstrating socket communication.

## Description

This project consists of two Java programs:

- **IntServer**: A server that listens on port 9999 and waits for clients to connect. When a client connects, it reads a number sent by the client and prints it to the console.
- **IntClient**: A client that connects to the server on localhost port 9999, generates a random number between 0 and 9, sends it to the server, and prints the number sent.

## How to Run

1. Compile both Java files:

   ```bash
   javac IntServer.java IntClient.java

    Open two terminal windows.

    In the first terminal, start the server:

java IntServer

In the second terminal, run the client:

    java IntClient

    You should see the client send a random number and the server receive and print it.

Features

    Basic socket communication between client and server.

    Server handles multiple connections in a loop (one at a time).

    Simple error handling and connection logging.

Notes

    Both programs run on the same machine (localhost).

    The server listens on port 9999 â€” make sure this port is free.

    This example uses the default package (no package declaration).
